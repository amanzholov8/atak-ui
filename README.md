## Main Features

Notice the following important features from the demo gif:
- _Help_ button is available so that anyone can know how to use the app.
- Addition and deletion of as many photos as possible per bar.
- Any action can be cancelled by using "Undo" button.
- Easy navigation through the track timeline.
- The speed of scrolling is adjustable.
- **Looping** is possible for convenient choreo rehearsals.
- Users can adjust their tracks by pressing _Edit Audio_ button.

What is also worth to mention:
- We paid attention on **efficiency, learnability, and safety** of the UI, as the goal of the project was to create a user-friendly app with UI matching all these criteria.
- The app is dynamic and it actually works. Our ideas for course project prototype did not just remain in our heads. They actually got implemented.
